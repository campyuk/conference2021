Given that CHRO2021 has been cancelled (http://chro.bomeeting.net/newsinfo/795), and there has not been a Campy-UK since 2015 (Liverpool); we (the shady campy cabal) felt that there should be a “virtual conference” so we can bring together the Campylobacter scientific community together and share our science. Campy-UK is historically an ad hoc conference, often in the years between a CHRO. For this particular Campy-UK, we felt it was a great opportunity to expand Campy-UK global, especially with this conference being held virtually, and so this conference is open to anyone that is interested.

The conference is completely free and we are aiming to best translate the conference experience into a virtual meeting, including the social/networking aspect. 

There will five sessions from 8th - 10th of September. Conscious of different time zones, we have tried to accommodate as many regions as possible (apologies if there are some late nights!). 

## Topics at this meeting
Topics at this meeting, include but are not limited to: 
* Survival and Application
* Pathogenicity, immunology, virulence factors and AMR
* Is it the song or the singer - what shapes host adaptation in Campylobacter?
* Trends in Campylobacter epidemiology and public health

### Survival and Application
In this topic we will explore control and prevention of Campylobacter, survival in the host or the environment and how the bacteria interacts with the host. Presentations can be on any method or technology that is used to control Campylobacter on farm and during processing, including but not limited to vaccines, dietary additives, biosecurity and  interventions during processing including washes or chilling. Presentations on how Campylobacter survive in the environment, host or during processing along with host-pathogen interactions are also welcomed. 

### Pathogenicity, immunology, virulence factors and AMR
Presentations can be focussed on genes that encode for proteins that are involved in virulence/pathogenicity of Campylobacter spp. These could include genes involved in stress response, genes involved in encoding for factors that relate to adhesion and invasion, intracellular survival, secreted effectors. They could include studies into key structures such as the flagella, the Type VI Secretion System (T6SS), Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) and the capsule to name a few. The session will also consider aspects of immunity, whether this is host immune response to Campylobacter infection, or cellular mechanisms of how Campylobacter infection can lead to inflammation, mechanism of immune avoidance and novel animal models to study Campylobacter infection at the immune level. The theme will also incorporate aspects of AMR linked to Campylobacter. 

### Is it the song or the singer - what shapes host adaptation in Campylobacter?
Within the genus Campylobacter there are species/lineages that inhabit the gut of different animals and species/lineages that inhabit different niches within a single animal. The maintenance of these species/lineages as discrete entities depends on barriers to genetic exchange, which can be physical - with species/lineages inhabiting different niches, or adaptive - implying selection against hybrid lineages. By considering genes (songs), rather than species/lineages (singers) as units of selection can we improve quantification of the relative importance of these barriers to recombination? In this session we will consider different examples and the different selection pressures that 
drive host-adaptation in a variety of Campylobacter species and lineages.

### Trends in Campylobacter epidemiology and public health
In this session we will consider trends in contemporary clinical microbiology and public health, including outbreak reports, Campylobacter epidemiology studies and emergence of specific clinical species or lineages
