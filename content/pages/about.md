Given that CHRO2021 has been cancelled (http://chro.bomeeting.net/newsinfo/795), and there has not been a CampyUK since 2014 (Liverpool); a group of [*Campylobacter* researchers](https://campyuk.github.io/conference2021/pages/aboutus/) felt that there should be a “virtual conference” so we can bring together the *Campylobacter* scientific community together and share our science. CampyUK is historically an *ad hoc* conference, often in the years between a CHRO. For this particular CampyUK, we felt it was a great opportunity to expand CampyUK globally, especially as this conference will be held virtually. The conference is open to anyone that is interested.

The conference is free and we are aiming to translate the experience including social and networking aspects into a virtual meeting.  

There will five sessions from 8th - 10th of September. Conscious of different time zones, we have tried to accommodate as many regions as possible (apologies if there are some late nights!). 

The official hashtag is [#campyuk](https://twitter.com/hashtag/campyuk)

## Topics at this meeting
Topics at this meeting, include but are not limited to: 
* Survival and Application
* Pathogenicity, immunology, virulence factors and AMR
* Is it the song or the singer - what shapes host adaptation in *Campylobacter*?
* Trends in *Campylobacter* epidemiology and public health

### Survival and application
In this session we will explore control and prevention of *Campylobacter*, survival in the host or the environment and how the bacteria interacts with the host. Presentations can be on any method or technology that is used to control *Campylobacter* on farm and during processing, including but not limited to vaccines, dietary additives, biosecurity and  interventions during processing including washes or chilling. Presentations on how *Campylobacter* survive in the environment, host or during processing along with host-pathogen interactions are also welcomed. 

### Pathogenicity, immunology, virulence factors and AMR
Presentations can be focussed on genes that encode for proteins that are involved in virulence/pathogenicity, stress response, adhesion, invasion, intracellular survival and secreted effectors. Presentations can also discuss key structures such as the flagella, Type VI Secretion System, Outer Membrane Vesicles and the capsule to name a few. The session will also consider aspects of immunity, whether this is the host immune response to *Campylobacter* infection, inflammation, mechanisms of immune avoidance and novel animal models to study *Campylobacter* infection. The session will also incorporate aspects of AMR linked to *Campylobacter*. 

### Is it the song or the singer - what shapes host adaptation in *Campylobacter*?
In this session we will consider different examples of host adaptation and the variety in of selection pressures that drive host-adaptation. Within the genus *Campylobacter* there are lineages that inhabit both the gut of different animals; and different niches within a single animal. The maintenance of these lineages as discrete entities depends on barriers to genetic exchange, which can be physical - with lineages inhabiting different niches, or functional - with clear phenotypic advantages. By considering genes (songs), rather than lineages (singers) as units of selection, can we identify barriers to recombination?

### Trends in *Campylobacter* epidemiology and public health
In this session we will consider trends in contemporary clinical microbiology and public health, including outbreak reports, *Campylobacter* epidemiology studies and emergence of specific clinical species or lineages. We encourage presentations of AMR from an epidemiology perspective.
