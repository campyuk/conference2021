We are pleased to announce that abstract submissions are now open for oral presentations for *CampyUK goes global 2021*. 

Please register and submit your abstract for consideration by the organisers using this link: https://forms.gle/6ek3b6s6TRQHiyLw5 

The deadline for abstract submissions (oral presentations) is **25th June 2021**. 


## Abstract Submission Guideline

Abstracts are limited to 3,000 characters (no spaces).  This does not include the title, author list or affiliations.

The abstract should summarise the research in a concise and informative way, as it is the only information organisers will have when deciding what presentations will be accepted. Abstracts do not have to be structured in sections, however all abstracts should have a brief background statement summarising the basis for the work, and the aim of the work followed by methods, results and a concluding statement to bring the work into context within the research area.

Submission should include an informative title, author list, affiliations, and abstract text.
