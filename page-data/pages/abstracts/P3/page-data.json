In addition to causing human illness, some strains of <em>Campylobacter</em> stimulate an immune response in chickens. Inflammation in the avian gut mucosa causes significant damage to the intestinal epithelium, facilitating the extraintestinal spread of <em>Campylobacter</em> to muscle and liver tissues. We hypothesized that <em>Campylobacter</em> extraintestinal spread from the chicken gut would be limited by controlling gut mucosa inflammation and reducing <em>Campylobacter</em> growth using organic compounds (butyric acid, caprylic acid and chromium propionate). Twenty-three strains of <em>Campylobacter</em> from naturally infected broiler chickens were tested for invasive capacity in vitro and five were selected for further study (two control strains, and a gut, liver and caecal strain). First, we explored the direct effect of organic compounds on <em>Campylobacter</em> growth; it was found that butyric and caprylic acid, but not chromium propionate, reduced <em>Campylobacter</em> growth in a concentration and pH dependent manner. At the strain level, only the reduction in growth of the gut strain was significant. Secondly, we used gentamicin protection assays of avian 8E11 and human CaCo-2 gut cells precultured with organic compounds to explore their effect on bacterial invasion. The treatments were not cytotoxic per se, and they reduced <em>Campylobacter</em> invasion in a concentration dependent manner. In conclusion, organic acids reduced <em>Campylobacter</em> invasion and growth in vitro. These findings imply that organic acids have the potential to be used as feed additives to control <em>Campylobacter</em> in chickens.</p>\n<h3 id=\"about-the-presenter\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#about-the-presenter\" aria-label=\"about the presenter permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>About the presenter</h3>\n<p>I am Amy Hillier a 3rd year PhD research student at Swansea University Medical School in the microbiology and infectious diseases group.
