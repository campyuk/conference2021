D in Biostatistics (a collaborative Ph. D program between biostatistics and infectious disease epidemiology). A priority in my work has been statistical analysis of both genomic and epidemiological data of infectious diseases, and development and management of information technology programs and databases in life science and medicine. In 2012, I started a long-term stay in UK (hosted by Sam Sheppard) as a government-funded JSPS Research Fellow of University of Tokyo to develop collaborative research projects primarily with Daniel Falush, Xavier Didelot, and Sam Sheppard (published as 3 papers in MBE, 2 of which analyzed hundreds of <em>Campylobacter</em> genome sequences). Based on the experience, I have been continuing international research projects.  In 2016, I moved to National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan to be responsible for a national comprehensive AMR surveillance system (JANIS), which is now evolving for including isolate-based genomic surveillance linked to it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Campy AMR surveillance - how to incorporate WGS?","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/abstracts/KY/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","825871152"]}
