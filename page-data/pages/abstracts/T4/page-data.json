The largest contributors of human campylobacteriosis in developed countries are poultry and poultry products. The current European legislation regulates levels of <em>Campylobacter</em> on the neck skin from broiler carcasses at the slaughterhouse. However, there have been outbreaks of campylobacteriosis attributed to undercooked chicken livers. There is a lack of information on the occurrence of <em>Campylobacter</em> in chicken livers in Spain. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and levels of <em>C. jejuni</em> and <em>C. coli</em> in chicken livers by sampling 56 flocks from two slaughterhouses in Catalonia, northeastern Spain. Three carcasses per flock were collected randomly during the evisceration of the animals, thus analyzing in total 168 liver and ceca samples. Prevalence of <em>Campylobacter</em> from liver surface, inner tissue, and cecal contents were compared by chi-square test for independence. Overall, <em>Campylobacter</em> prevalence was 54,8% in cecal samples, whilst in the liver surface and the internal tissue was 71,4% and 35,1%, respectively. Out of the 92 <em>Campylobacter</em>-positive cecal samples, 45,7% were <em>C. coli</em>-positive, 48,9% were <em>C. jejuni</em>-positive and in the remaining 5,4% of these samples, coinfections with both bacteria were identified. Among the 120 <em>Campylobacter</em>-positive samples of the external surface of the liver, 40,0% were positive to <em>C. coli</em>, 45,8% were positive to <em>C. jejuni</em> and in the remaining 14,2% of these samples, we found coinfections with both bacteria. Finally, out of the 59 <em>Campylobacter</em>-positive samples of internal tissue liver, a 37,3% were <em>C. coli</em>-positive, a 52,5% were <em>C. jejuni</em>-positive, whilst in the remaining 10,2% samples we detected coinfections with both bacteria. However, no relation was found between <em>Campylobacter</em> species (<em>C. jejuni</em>, <em>C. coli</em>) identified and type of the sample (P>0,05). Coinfections were more prevalent in the livers than in the ceca. The data highlights chicken livers as a potential source of human campylobacteriosis, not only due to the <em>Campylobacter</em> prevalence but particularly because of the bacterial load, which was >103 CFU/liver or >103 CFU/g respectively, in 40,1% of the samples of surface liver and in 6,6% of the internal tissue samples. Further research is needed to determine the potential risk of campylobacteriosis due to consumption of chicken livers.</p>\n<p>Presenting in <a href=\"/conference2021/posts/campyuk-2021-session-3\">Speaking session 3 - Epidemiology and public health</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Campylobacter contamination of chicken livers at slaughter","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/abstracts/T4/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","825871152"]}
