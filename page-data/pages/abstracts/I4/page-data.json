H. Srensen </p>\n<p>University of Copenhagen, Denmark</p>\n<p>Phase variation is a common mechanism for creating phenotypic heterogeneity of surface structures in bac- teria important for niche adaptation. In Campylobacter, phase variation occurs by random variation in hyper- mutable homonucleotide 711 G (polyG) tracts. To elucidate how phages adapt to phase-variable hosts, we study Fletchervirus phages infecting Campylobacter dependent on a phase-variable receptor. Our data demonstrate that Fletcherviruses mimic their host and encode hypermutable polyG tracts, leading to phase-variable expression of two of four receptor-binding proteins. This creates phenotypically diverse phage populations, including a sub-population that infects the bacterial host when the phase-variable receptor is not expressed. Such population dynamics of both phage and host promote co-existence in a shared niche. Strikingly, we identify polyG tracts in more than 100 phage genera, infecting more than 70 bacterial species. Future experimental work may confirm phase variation as a widespread strategy for creating phenotypically diverse phage populations.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Campylobacter phages use hypermutable polyG tracts to create phenotypic diversity and evade bacterial resistance","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/abstracts/I4/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","825871152"]}
