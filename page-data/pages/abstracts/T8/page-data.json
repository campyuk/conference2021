Case-control studies of campylobacteriosis determine risk factors, but rarely differentiate between species. We conducted a case-control study linking whole genome sequence data to identify risk factors for C. jejuni and C. coli in Australia.   Methods: We recruited cases and controls frequency matched for age group, sex, and location. Interviewers used a standardised questionnaire to enter data into REDCap. We conducted logistic regression to identify risk factors after adjusting for matching variables. Public health laboratories obtained samples for all case and isolated Campylobacter spp..  Results: We recruited 586 controls and 571 cases (422 C. jejuni, 84 C. coli, 2 C. lari and 63 not speciated). Univariable risk factors for C. jejuni included use of proton-pump inhibitors (Odds Ratio 2.44;95% Confidence Interval 1.65-3.65), chicken consumption in general (OR 1.73;95% CI 1.11-2.75), eating undercooked chicken (OR 44.80; 95% CI 9.50-801), eating chicken kebabs (OR 2.46; 95% CI 1.55-3.97), contact with puppies &#x3C;6 months of age (OR 3.95; 95% CI 2.34-6.93), and having a new pet dog in the four weeks prior to infection (OR 8.68; 95% CI 3.62-25.8). For C. coli, risk factors included use of proton-pump inhibitors (OR 4.04; 95% CI 2.18-7.46), eating chicken pate (OR 5.13; 95% CI 1.42-17.5), eating homemade pate (OR 12.5; 95% CI 2.33-93.8), eating undercooked chicken (OR 33.2; 95% CI 5.36-643), and preparing fresh raw chicken (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.28-3.91).  We found that use of antibiotics in the four weeks prior to infection and eating undercooked beef were negatively associated with infection from both species.  Conclusions: Campylobacter infection is primarily foodborne, but other zoonotic sources and heightened risk due to regular medication use are also important. We observed differences in risk factors between C. jejuni and C. coli suggesting different sources of infection.  There is a need to minimise Campylobacter contamination of the chicken meat supply chain and for consumers to understand risks associated with pets and proton-pump inhibitors.</p>\n<h3 id=\"about-the-presenter\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#about-the-presenter\" aria-label=\"about the presenter permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>About the presenter</h3>\n<p>Danielle Cribb is a PhD candidate at the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health at the Australian National University. Her PhD focuses on analysing factors affecting the burden of Campylobacter infections in Australia. This PhD is a continuation of the NHMRC funded project Understanding the Sources of Campylobacter in Australia, and aims to translate the results of this study to improve understanding of Campylobacter infections in Australia, identify risk factors for infection, and describe the burden of Campylobacter at an individual and population level.  Danielle receives funding from an Australian Government Research Training Program scholarship. Danielle has worked as a research assistant in foodborne disease research since 2019.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Risk factors for Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli infections in Australia","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/abstracts/T8/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","825871152"]}
