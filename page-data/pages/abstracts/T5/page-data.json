Poultry, and especially broiler chickens, is considered an important reservoir for Campylobacter spp.. To customized actions in abattoirs, such as freezing of carcasses, it is important to identify Campylobacter-positive flocks before slaughter. Our first objective was to evaluate the applicability, sensitivity, and specificity of four rapid methods to detect Campylobacter in naturally contaminated chicken cecal droppings on-farm before slaughter. A second objective was to compare Campylobacter infection status in chickens one week prior to slaughter and at slaughter. Methods: Ninety samples were analyzed for the presence of Campylobacter using two molecular (Biofire Filmarray Gastrointestinal Panel, OptiGenes Genie Campylobacter isothermal qPCR) and two rapid immunological methods (mini VIDAS Campylobacter, Singlepath Campylobacter) and the results were compared with those of an established qPCR. Further, 122 flocks were tested for the presence of Campylobacter six and one day prior to slaughter using the established qPCR and the OptiGenes Genie Campylobacter isothermal qPCR. Results: The Biofire Filmarray was superior in sensitivity and specificity compared to the three other rapid tests but had lower throughput and higher cost. The Singlepath, miniVIDAS and Genie had unsatisfactory sensitivity (10%-71%), leaving these unsuitable as sole methods in a Campylobacter surveillance program. Further, 38% of Campylobacter positive flocks at slaughter were negative a week before, meaning that these flocks contracted Campylobacter during the last week of rearing.  Conclusions: Increased efforts to develop rapid methods for the detection of Campylobacter in broilers are needed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"about-the-presenter\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#about-the-presenter\" aria-label=\"about the presenter permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>About the presenter</h3>\n<p>Veterinarian, microbiologist and an advocate for implementation of modern molecular methods to improve human and animal health, all within the One Health paradigm.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Rapid detection of Campylobacter in chicken flocks","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/abstracts/T5/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","825871152"]}
