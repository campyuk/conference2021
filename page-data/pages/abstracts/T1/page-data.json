Campylobacter contamination in poultry and poultry product has been reported worldwide. The present study aims to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter in poultry feces using selective enrichment Bolton broth and multiplex PCR. Method. Two methods were used in this study; the first is direct plating of poultry feces into mCCDA agar plates. The second, three antibiotics were used at different concentration to add in Bolton broth supplemented. These antibiotics was  Rifampicin (Oxoid, Nepean, Ontario) with 10mg/L, colistin (Oxoid, Nepean, Ontario) with 1mg/mL and 2mg/mL; trimethoprim (Oxoid, Nepean, Ontario) with 10mg/L. The colonies with typical campylobacter morphology on blood agar (little, red and ring colonies) were further identified to the species level by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  Results. The addition of colistin (2mg/mL) to the Bolton broth with selective supplements enhanced the selective isolation of Campylobacter strains. Out of the 52 feces samples, 18 (34.61%) were positive for campylobacter and direct plating on mCCDA 11 (21.15%) campylobacter strains (p &#x3C; 0.05). The PCR results has shown that 17 (94.45%) of the campylobacter strains detected were belong to Campylobacter coli and 1(5.55%) strains belong to campylobacter jejuni. Conclusion. Although it is known to be difficult to isolate Campylobacter from animal feces samples, this study showed that antibiotic selective pressure improves the isolation efficiency of Campylobacter from poultry feces.
