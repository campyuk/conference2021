Like many foodborne zoonoses, Campylobacter transmission can occur via multiple pathways including through direct contact with the excrement of colonised poultry, wild birds and infected humans, or through contaminated water and environments. Yet, our knowledge of the sources of transmission to infants is still limited. The objective of this analysis is to identify possible routes of Campylobacter transmission to young infants in households and communities. Pregnant women in their last trimester (n=220) were recruited from the ongoing Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) in Mirzapur, Bangladesh. Baseline stool samples were collected from women during pregnancy (mothers, n=220) and from a child &#x3C;5 years of age (siblings, n=73), when applicable. Samples from 81% of the study participants (mothers and newborns, n=209; siblings, n=66) were collected again within 14 days of delivery (range 2-14 days). Pooled animal stools, from households owning animals were collected only at baseline. Exposure survey data were collected at each sampling. Samples were tested for Campylobacter via culture and PCR. Samples that were culture and/or PCR positive were considered positive for this analysis. Data were collected using EpiCollect (data collection tool), and analyzed using Stata 16.0. Frequencies and bivariate analysis were used to estimate the association between the outcome (Campylobacter infection) and exposures. At baseline, 29% (64/220) of households had at least one positive human and/or animal sample, and 4.5% of households had a positive pregnant woman (10/220). In households where one sibling was tested, 11% (8/73) were positive, and one household had both a pregnant woman and child &#x3C;5yrs test positive.  Of the households with animals, 39% (57/146) contained a positive animal sample, the majority of which were from poultry (n=52), and six households had both human and animal samples test positive. At the follow-up visit, 2% of mothers (5/209), 5% of siblings (3/64) and 0.5% (1/209) infants were positive and no household had more than one positive human sample. One household had positive human samples at both the baseline and follow-up survey. There was no statistically significant association between human and animal infection (p-val=0.07).  Carriage of Campylobacter was high in the study samples and exposure to poultry may be an important risk factor for transmission in this community. Next steps include comparison of Campylobacter genomics within positive households, statistical analysis to identify behavioral and other risk factors and specimen collection 6 months after birth.</p>\n<h3 id=\"about-the-presenter\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#about-the-presenter\" aria-label=\"about the presenter permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>About the presenter</h3>\n<p>Being a postgraduate in Social Science (Sociology), I have always cherished to make a career in upgrading the status of social, economic and health contexts of people. I do look for diverse opportunities from development sector, involving corresponding national and international authorities to ameliorate the quality indices of peoples life especially where I can contribute through my expertise. To accomplish such purpose I have accrued more than ten years of professional experiences working with different national and international bodies in variety of qualitative and quantitative research work and implementation of policies involved.   All along the journey throughout my career till now, maintaining liaison, advocacy &#x26; capacity building with responsible authorities to execute target goal have always been the priority.
