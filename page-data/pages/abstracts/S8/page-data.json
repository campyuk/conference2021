There is no current vaccine and antibiotic resistance is emerging. There is an urgent need to understand fundamental <em>C. jejuni</em> biology for the development of new strategies to prevent and treat infections. The range of molecular tools available to regulate gene expression in <em>C. jejuni</em> is limited, which in turn constrains our ability to interrogate the function of essential and conditionally essential genes. My project aims to address this by applying a CRISPR-based interference system known as CRISPRi in <em>C. jejuni</em> as a means to control gene expression and thereby investigate gene function. To validate the CRISPRi system in <em>C. jejuni</em>, I have paired the dCas9 and sgRNA backbone from the Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPRi system with <em>C. jejuni</em>-derived promoters of pre-determined activities to develop a series of CRISPRi constructs targeting several genes. Through rigorous sgRNA target design I have successfully targeted and repressed expression of the endogenous arylsulphatase (AstA) enzyme in two <em>C. jejuni</em> strains (81-176 and M1Cam). Further, I have investigated whether sgRNA target location impacts the efficacy of CRISPRi repression by designing sgRNAs that span the length of the astA gene from 5 to 3. I have also assessed whether the endogenous Type-II CRISPR-Cas system in M1Cam impairs the efficacy of the exogenous CRISPRi through the generation of CRISPRi strains using an M1Cam CRISPR-Cas9 deletion mutant. Finally, I have applied the CRISPRi system to target further genes, including the hippicurase enzyme hipO, and a series of motility genes, including flaA, flaB, and flgR. To date, this is the first report of a CRISPR-based interference system demonstrated in <em>C. jejuni</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"about-the-presenter\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#about-the-presenter\" aria-label=\"about the presenter permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>About the presenter</h3>\n<p>I am a final year PhD student in Dr. Andrew Grantâ€™s group at the University of Cambridge.</p>\n<p>Presenting in <a href=\"/conference2021/posts/campyuk-2021-session-4\">Speaking session 4 - Survival and application</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Establishing CRISPR interference system in Campylobacter jejuni","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/abstracts/S8/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","825871152"]}
