On wet food processing surfaces with sufficient roughness and topography for attachment, providing nutrients for microbial growth, biofilms become a challenge to food safety and human health, as they persist and become a source of cross-contamination with multi-drug resistant strains. Thus the normally fragile and fastidious microaerophilic planktonic cells of <em>Campylobacter</em>, which have limited hardiness and growth capacity, benefit significantly from their biofilm phenotype. For more than a decade, <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> has been the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in industrialized countries worldwide, with the incidence and prevalence of campylobacteriosis mostly associated with consumption of undercooked poultry meat, unpasteurized milk, or contaminated water.  Our research focuses on understanding the basic mechanisms of adhesion, which is considered the first phase of multistage biofilm formation. To this end, we study planktonic, adherent and biofilm cells using modern molecular approaches and determine gene expression and protein profiles by RNA-seq and mass spectrometry. By linking these data to the physiology of <em>C. jejuni</em> NCNC 11168, we aim to identify key mechanisms as potential targets for innovative control strategies. The starting point is the quantitative evaluation of the adhesion of <em>C. jejuni</em> NCTC11168 to the abiotic surface of polystyrene. The basic mechanisms involved in adhesion were investigated (i) at the metabolic level by characterizing growth, motility, morphology and biomass of the mutants and (ii) at the level of specific cell adhesins by using lectins that bind to the bacterial surface.  After the initial phase of adhesion to the polystyrene in the first 12 hours, the number of cells increases slightly up to 24 hours, after which the number of cells in the formed biofilm decreases. By modeling adhesion to polystyrene, we showed that: (i) different cellular mechanisms are involved and that we can modulate both adhesion by affecting efflux pumps and the cellâ€™s stress response by affecting signaling systems, thereby reducing adhesion. Furthermore, using a fungal lectin that specifically binds to outer membrane proteins and extracellular proteins, we demonstrated the involvement of specific adhesins and identified new extracellular matrix molecules involved in adhesion to polystyrene, including: Flagellin A, major outer membrane protein, outer membrane tyrosine kinase, outer membrane fibronectin-binding protein, and amino acid-binding periplasmic protein.</p>\n<h3 id=\"about-the-presenter\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#about-the-presenter\" aria-label=\"about the presenter permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>About the presenter</h3>\n<p>Nationality: Slovene </p>\n<p>Academic title: Ph.
