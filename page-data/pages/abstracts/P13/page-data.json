After adhesion and proliferation, protein and polysaccharide-mediated interactions between bacteria promote the establishment of a mature biofilm, which is enveloped by the extracellular matrix composed of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids and lipids. This provides the structural support and facilitates effective intercellular communication for the establishment of the biofilm community.  As known, the main adhesins that allow adhesion to the surface and to other microorganisms are various: fimbriae, flagella, lipopolysaccharide layer, capsule, lectins, many proteins and lipooligosaccharides. We focus on the adhesion of Campylobacter jejuni to the abiotic polystyrene surface with the aim of investigating the molecularly mediated binding between specific adhesins and the surface. For this purpose, we include the compounds of natural origin, Lavandula angustifolia essential oil, that reduce cell adhesion of C. jejuni to abiotic surfaces (Rami et al., AEM 2021, in press). To determine the adhesins involved at the molecular level, we determine total transcriptome gene expression by next-generation RNA sequencing in a 16-h control culture of C. jejuni NTCT 11168 and in cells treated for 30 min with subinhibitory concentrations of Lavandula angustifolia essential oil (LEO) and the two main compound present in this essential oil, namely linalool (LL) and linalyl acetate (LA). The results showed that several putative adhesins were modulated at the gene expression level. Interestingly, the majority of genes involved in bacterial adhesion were downregulated regardless of the treatment used. Specifically, analysis of significantly differentially expressed genes (absolute fold change, FC 1, P 0.05) in treated samples compared to the control treated with the solvent dimetyl sulfoxide (DMSO) showed for several genes speculated in the literature to be involved in bacterial adhesion in C. jejuni, namely (i) for LEO-treated porA, flgG, flgI, flaG, peb3, peb2, fliQ, motA, pdlA; (ii) for LL-treated flgB, fliK, fliA, and (iii) for LA-treated Cj1349, flgE, flgD, flgI, Peb1a, Peb1C. The flagellar genes present from 0.9 % to 2.0 % of total transcriptome gene expression. We can conclude that the greatest effect was observed in the expression of genes involved in bacterial motility, which are thought to be important for bacterial adhesion and also Campylobacter cell invasion. Moreover, putative adhesins thus represent a potential target for the control of Campylobacter in clinical settings and in animal production.</p>\n<h3 id=\"about-the-presenter\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#about-the-presenter\" aria-label=\"about the presenter permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>About the presenter</h3>\n<h2 id=\"resubmitting-the-correct-abstract-applying-for-posters-if-they-will-be-available\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#resubmitting-the-correct-abstract-applying-for-posters-if-they-will-be-available\" aria-label=\"resubmitting the correct abstract applying for posters if they will be available permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Resubmitting the correct abstract.
