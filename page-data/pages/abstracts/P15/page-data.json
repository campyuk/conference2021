The most common species, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, infect humans mostly via contaminated meat and can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever. In severe cases of campylobacteriosis, the administration of antibiotics such as macrolides (azithromycin) is required but the emergence of new resistance mechanisms, particularly among C. coli isolates, is concerning. The aim of this study was to analyze the resistance profiles of Campylobacter multi-resistant isolates received at the CNRCH from 2016 to 2019.   First, 42 C. coli and 9 C. jejuni multi-resistant isolates were selected for DNA extraction using MagNA Pure systems and genome sequencing using Illumina technology. Resistance markers were identified using bioinformatic tools combined with multiple databases. PCR screening of two identified methyltransferases (erm) conferring resistance to erythromycin were performed on 141 C. coli and 30 C. jejuni erythromycin-resistant isolates. Additionally, bacterial transformations were performed to improve understanding of methyltransferases transmission. Finally, erythromycin MICs were estimated for 9 erm-positive isolates and 15 other erythromycin-resistant isolates with 23S rDNA mutations.   Genomic analyses of erythromycin resistant isolates revealed 23S mutations in 93% of all isolates and two methyltransferases were found in the remaining 7%: ErmB (1 C. coli) and a novel methylase named here ErmN (3 C. coli). ermB gene, initially described asian isolates, is found in a multidrug-resistant gene island and ermN, described only once in a Canadian study in 2018, is inserted within CRISPR arrays of CRISPR-cas9 operon. After PCR screening of 171 erythromycin-resistant isolates, 3 ermN positive C. coli from 2016 (3%) and 2 ermB positive C. coli (1%) were also identified. Bacterial transformations confirmed that insertion of ermN into a CRISPR-cas9 operon can confer macrolide resistance. However, methylase-positive isolates have MIC levels compared to erythromycin-resistant isolates containing 23SrDNA mutations.  Campylobacter species are easily able to adapt to their environment and acquire new resistance mechanisms, especially C. coli. This study is so far the first description of Erythromycin Resistance Methyltransferases in Campylobacters isolated from French clinical cases. The emergence of this new resistance mechanisms has to be followed carefully in the next years.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"First description of Erythromycin Resistance Methyltransferases in Campylobacter coli strains in France","date":null,"description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/abstracts/P15/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","825871152"]}
