Those, however, have been developed using experimental challenge-rechallenge study data only. For estimating the immunity parameters we used the recently published MAL-ED study data on Campylobacter status, both serology and PCR, in diarrheic and non-diarrheic children from low-resource settings. The previously proposed infection dynamics model by Swart et. al. 2016 was extended and MAL-ED data was used for model fitting. We propose a dynamic age-dependent model of immunity using the ABC (Approximate Bayesian Computation) algorithm at its core for simulation and optimizing the parameter estimation. Data from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Peru, and Pakistan, were used for this study, and immune parameters were estimated for Campylobacter jejuni/coli (CjCc) and Campylobacter species (Cspp), using data collected via PCR and ELISA based detection. For CjCc the estimated force of infection was in the range of 3-7 year-1, while for Cspp, it was found to be in a little higher range of 5-20 year-1. A similar trend was observed for the estimated duration of full protection being 0.037-0.082 years and  0.054-0.084 years for CjCc and Cspp respectively. Duration of partial protection was found to be higher for both CjCc and Cspp, in the range of 0.16-0.32 years and 0.07- 0.25 years. Incidences of Campylobacter-associated diarrhea (year-1) were found to be in the range of 3-4  and 3-10 for CjCc and Cspp respectively. These estimates are quite higher than MAL-ED reported population attributable fraction (PAF) and support the hypothesis that PAF estimates are biased due to their inability to exclude the protected people in the cohort. The current model can be used to predict the impact of changing the exposure frequency and dose on the prevalence of Campylobacter in children, to support hygiene interventions in low-resource settings. It provides novel opportunities to estimate the incidence of pathogen-specific diarrheal illness in high exposure populations and yields insight into the mechanisms of waning and boosting. However, currently due to the unavailability of data confirming the immune status of the population cohort, the model fitting was quite complex and computationally expensive. So, the current findings also suggest the need for more serological testing to confirm the partial or full protection status of the selected population cohort and allow better fitting of the model for estimating the illness incidences in the population.
